Complete rewrite of FunFX.

* 13 major enhancements:
  * FunFX is a plugin to Watir/SafariWatir/FireWatir
  * The FunFX API is statically generated code instead of dynamically generated
  * Big poster with class diagram
  * Hash based lookup of elements
  * Flex stacktrace is included in Ruby stack trace
  * Elements can be looked up by a "path" of ids: several hashes
  * Types are coerced back to correct Ruby types when asking for properties
  * Full demo app included in the source tree
  * Moved to Git
  * Automated build using Rake
  * Proper packaging as a Ruby gem
  * Automated testing using RSpec
  * The code is largely based on Adobe's AutoQuick example
